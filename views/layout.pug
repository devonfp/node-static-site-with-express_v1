          p  My name is Devon and I love a lot of things about the web! As of now I have yet to have much experience in the workforce, but I know that with experience comes knowledge and knowledge comes with patience, time, and dedication. Furthermore, I'm a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills and I'm excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic looking websites.
